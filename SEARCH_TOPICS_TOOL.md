# Search Topics Tool - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Added a new `search_topics` MCP tool that allows searching the DataTopics table by name or description. This complements the existing `list_topics` and `search_by_topic` tools to provide a complete topic discovery workflow.

## What Was Added

### New Implementation Function

**`search_topics_impl(search_text, max_results=20)`**
- Searches the DataTopics table for topics matching the search text
- Searches both `name` and `description` columns
- Returns matching topics with their IDs, names, and descriptions
- Parameters:
  - `search_text`: Text to search for in topic names/descriptions
  - `max_results`: Maximum number of results (default: 20)

### New MCP Tool

**`search_topics(search_text, max_results=20)`**
- Exposed as an MCP tool for LLM agents
- Includes detailed agent instructions for when to use it
- Provides examples of common searches
- Returns structured topic data

## Use Cases

### 1. Topic Discovery
```python
# Find topics related to genetics
search_topics("gene")
# Returns: Gene, Genome, Transcript, Transcriptome, Variant, etc.
```

### 2. Domain Exploration
```python
# Discover imaging-related topics
search_topics("imaging")
# Returns: Image, Microscale Imaging, Neurologic Imaging, Ophthalmic Imaging
```

### 3. Workflow: Search Topics → Find Standards
```python
# Step 1: Find relevant topics
topics = search_topics("patient")
# Returns: Clinical Observations

# Step 2: Get standards for that topic
standards = search_by_topic("Clinical Observations")
# Returns: Standards tagged with that topic
```

## Agent Instructions

The tool includes guidance for LLM agents:

**When to use:**
- User wants to find topics related to a specific term
- Discovering what data domains are available for a concept
- Before using `search_by_topic` to find the exact topic name
- Exploring what kinds of data are covered

**Examples:**
- "What topics are related to genetics?" → `search_topics("genetic")`
- "Are there topics about medical imaging?" → `search_topics("imaging")`
- "Show me topics about patient data" → `search_topics("patient")`

## Test Results

### Search Examples

| Search Term | Topics Found | Example Results |
|-------------|--------------|-----------------|
| "gene" | 8 | Gene, Genome, Transcript, Transcriptome, Variant |
| "patient" | 1 | Clinical Observations |
| "imaging" | 4 | Image, Microscale Imaging, Neurologic Imaging, Ophthalmic Imaging |
| "time" | 4 | EKG, Waveform, Glucose Monitoring, Training |
| "health" | 7 | Disease, EHR, mHealth, Environment |
| "data" | 10 | Biology, Cheminformatics, Clinical Observations, Data, Demographics |

### Test Suite

All 31 tests passing:
- ✅ `test_search_topics.py` - 3 new tests for search_topics functionality
- ✅ All existing tests still pass (28 tests)

## Complete Topic Tools Suite

The MCP now provides 3 complementary tools for topic exploration:

1. **`list_topics()`** - Lists all 52 topics
   - Use when: Need to see all available topics
   
2. **`search_topics(search_text)`** - Search topics by keyword
   - Use when: Looking for topics related to a concept
   
3. **`search_by_topic(topic_name)`** - Find standards for a topic
   - Use when: Know the topic name and want related standards

## Example Usage

### Command Line
```bash
# Search for topics
uv run python tests/example_search_topics.py "gene"
uv run python tests/example_search_topics.py "imaging"

# Demo complete workflow
uv run python tests/example_search_topics.py
```

### Python/MCP
```python
from fastmcp import Client
from standards_explorer_mcp.main import mcp

async with Client(mcp) as client:
    # Search for topics
    results = await client.call_tool("search_topics", {
        "search_text": "gene",
        "max_results": 10
    })
    
    # Results include topics matching "gene"
    for topic in results.data['topics']:
        print(f"{topic['name']}: {topic['description']}")
```

## Benefits

1. **Better Discovery** - Users can explore topics by keywords
2. **Flexible Search** - Searches both names and descriptions
3. **Complete Workflow** - search_topics → search_by_topic → get standards
4. **Agent-Friendly** - Includes detailed instructions for LLM agents
5. **Complements Existing Tools** - Works alongside list_topics and search_by_topic

## Files Modified

- `src/standards_explorer_mcp/main.py`
  - Added `search_topics_impl()` function
  - Added `@mcp.tool` wrapper for `search_topics()`

## Files Created

- `tests/test_search_topics.py` - Tests for search_topics functionality
- `tests/example_search_topics.py` - Interactive demo CLI

## MCP Tools Summary

Now provides **7 MCP tools** total:
1. `query_table` - Direct SQL queries
2. `search_standards` - Text search in standards (with auto topic search)
3. `get_standards_table_info` - Table metadata
4. `search_with_variations` - Multi-term search with deduplication
5. `search_by_topic` - Find standards by topic name
6. `list_topics` - List all available topics
7. **`search_topics`** ⭐ NEW - Search topics by keyword
