# Organization Functionality Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of organization search functionality for the Standards Explorer MCP server. The implementation follows the established pattern from topics and substrates, providing consistent multi-dimensional search capabilities for discovering standards by the organizations that create, maintain, or govern them.

## Implementation Summary

### New Features

1. **Organization Caching System**
   - `SYNAPSE_ORGANIZATIONS_TABLE_ID`: Table ID constant for Organization table (syn63096836)
   - `_ORGANIZATIONS_CACHE`: Global cache for organization name → ID mappings
   - `_load_organizations_mapping()`: Async function to query and cache organization mappings

2. **Organization Search Functions**
   - `search_by_organization_impl(organization_name, max_results, search_responsible_only)`: Search standards by organization name
   - `list_organizations_impl()`: List all available organizations with descriptions
   - `search_organizations_impl(search_text, max_results)`: Search organizations by keyword

3. **Enhanced Standard Search**
   - Updated `search_standards_impl()` to include automatic organization matching
   - Added `include_organization_search` parameter (default: True)
   - When search text matches an organization name, searches BOTH organization columns:
     - `has_relevant_organization`: Any organizations with relevance to the standard
     - `responsible_organization`: Organizations with governance over the standard
   - Returns `also_searched_organization` metadata when organization match occurs

4. **MCP Tool Wrappers**
   - `@mcp.tool search_by_organization`: Search standards for a specific organization
   - `@mcp.tool list_organizations`: List all available organizations
   - `@mcp.tool search_organizations`: Search organizations by keyword

5. **Updated Table Info**
   - `get_standards_table_info_impl()` now returns `organizations_table_id`

## Tool Count

The MCP server now provides **13 tools** (up from 10):

**Core Tools (4):**
1. `query_table` - Direct SQL query to standards table
2. `search_standards` - Enhanced text search with auto topic/substrate/organization matching
3. `get_standards_table_info` - Get table and project information
4. `search_with_variations` - Search with multiple term variations

**Topic Tools (3):**
5. `search_by_topic` - Search standards by data topic name
6. `list_topics` - List all available data topics
7. `search_topics` - Search topics by keyword

**Substrate Tools (3):**
8. `search_by_substrate` - Search standards by data substrate name
9. `list_substrates` - List all available data substrates
10. `search_substrates` - Search substrates by keyword

**Organization Tools (3) - NEW:**
11. `search_by_organization` - Search standards by organization name
12. `list_organizations` - List all available organizations
13. `search_organizations` - Search organizations by keyword

## Data Model

### Organization Table (syn63096836)

**Key Columns:**
- `id`: Organization identifier (e.g., "B2AI_ORG:1")
- `name`: Organization name (e.g., "HL7", "CDISC", "W3C")
- `description`: Detailed description of the organization
- `category`: Classification of organization type

**Sample Organizations (125 total):**
- 7B - Seven Bridges Genomics
- AHRQ - US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality
- AMA - American Medical Association
- ANSI - American National Standards Institute
- Apache - Apache Software Foundation
- ASTM - ASTM International
- CDC - Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
- CDISC - Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium
- HL7 - Health Level Seven
- IEEE - Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers
- ISO - International Organization for Standardization
- W3C - World Wide Web Consortium
- And 113 more...

### Standards Table Reference

The Standards table (syn63096833) has **TWO** organization columns:

1. **`has_relevant_organization`**: Any organization with relevance to the standard
   ```json
   ["B2AI_ORG:67", "B2AI_ORG:93"]
   ```

2. **`responsible_organization`**: Organizations with governance over the standard
   ```json
   ["B2AI_ORG:67"]
   ```

When searching by organization, the system searches BOTH columns by default, or only `responsible_organization` if `search_responsible_only=True`.

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: List All Organizations
```python
from standards_explorer_mcp.main import list_organizations_impl

result = await list_organizations_impl()
# Returns: {
#   "success": True,
#   "organizations": [
#     {"id": "B2AI_ORG:1", "name": "7B", "description": "Seven Bridges Genomics..."},
#     {"id": "B2AI_ORG:40", "name": "HL7", "description": "Health Level Seven..."},
#     ...
#   ],
#   "total_organizations": 125,
#   "table_id": "syn63096836"
# }
```

### Example 2: Search Organizations by Keyword
```python
from standards_explorer_mcp.main import search_organizations_impl

# Find healthcare-related organizations
result = await search_organizations_impl("health", max_results=5)
# Returns organizations like: AHRQ, CDC NCHS, GA4GH, HHS, HL7
```

### Example 3: Find Standards for an Organization
```python
from standards_explorer_mcp.main import search_by_organization_impl

# Find standards related to HL7 (searches both columns)
result = await search_by_organization_impl("HL7", max_results=20)
# Returns: {
#   "success": True,
#   "organization_name": "HL7",
#   "organization_id": "B2AI_ORG:40",
#   "search_method": "organization",
#   "search_responsible_only": False,
#   "rows": [...],  # Standards with HL7 in either column
#   ...
# }
```

### Example 4: Find Standards Where Organization is Responsible
```python
from standards_explorer_mcp.main import search_by_organization_impl

# Find standards where CDISC has governance (only responsible_organization)
result = await search_by_organization_impl(
    "CDISC", 
    max_results=20,
    search_responsible_only=True
)
# Returns standards where CDISC is in responsible_organization column
```

### Example 5: Enhanced Search (Automatic Organization Matching)
```python
from standards_explorer_mcp.main import search_standards_impl

# Search for "W3C" - automatically matches organization
result = await search_standards_impl("W3C", max_results=10)
# Returns: {
#   "success": True,
#   "search_text": "W3C",
#   "searched_columns": ["name", "description", "purpose_detail"],
#   "also_searched_organization": {
#     "organization_name": "W3C",
#     "organization_id": "B2AI_ORG:99"
#   },
#   "rows": [...]  # Standards matching "W3C" in text OR organization columns
# }
```

### Example 6: Multi-Dimensional Search
```python
# Search can now match across all dimensions simultaneously
result = await search_standards_impl("HL7")
# May match:
# - Text: Standards mentioning "HL7" in name/description
# - Organization: Standards where HL7 is relevant or responsible
# - Could also match topic or substrate if they existed
```

## Key Features

### Dual Column Search
Unlike topics and substrates which have only one reference column, organizations have two:
- **has_relevant_organization**: Broader - any relevant organization
- **responsible_organization**: Narrower - governance organizations only

The `search_by_organization_impl()` function provides a `search_responsible_only` parameter to control this behavior.

### Pattern Consistency

The organization implementation follows the exact same pattern as topics and substrates:

| Component | Topics | Substrates | Organizations |
|-----------|--------|------------|---------------|
| Table ID | syn63096835 | syn63096834 | syn63096836 |
| Primary Column | concerns_data_topic | has_relevant_data_substrate | has_relevant_organization |
| Secondary Column | - | - | responsible_organization |
| Cache | _TOPICS_CACHE | _SUBSTRATES_CACHE | _ORGANIZATIONS_CACHE |
| Loader | _load_topics_mapping() | _load_substrates_mapping() | _load_organizations_mapping() |
| Search by X | search_by_topic_impl() | search_by_substrate_impl() | search_by_organization_impl() |
| List X | list_topics_impl() | list_substrates_impl() | list_organizations_impl() |
| Search X | search_topics_impl() | search_substrates_impl() | search_organizations_impl() |
| MCP Tool 1 | @mcp.tool search_by_topic | @mcp.tool search_by_substrate | @mcp.tool search_by_organization |
| MCP Tool 2 | @mcp.tool list_topics | @mcp.tool list_substrates | @mcp.tool list_organizations |
| MCP Tool 3 | @mcp.tool search_topics | @mcp.tool search_substrates | @mcp.tool search_organizations |

6. **Multi-dimensional**: Confirm search can match topic, substrate, AND organization

## Agent Instructions

When the MCP tools are exposed to an AI agent:

1. **Discovery Workflow:**
   - Use `list_organizations` to see all available organizations
   - Use `search_organizations` to find relevant organizations by keyword
   - Use `search_by_organization` to find standards from specific organizations

2. **Governance vs Relevance:**
   - Default: searches both `has_relevant_organization` and `responsible_organization`
   - Use `search_responsible_only=True` when user asks about "maintained by", "governed by", "responsible for"
   - Use default when user asks about "related to", "from", "associated with"

3. **Enhanced Search:**
   - When user searches for an organization name (e.g., "HL7", "CDISC", "W3C"), `search_standards` automatically includes organization-based results
   - Agent sees metadata indicating organization match occurred

4. **Combined Search:**
   - Topics, substrates, AND organizations can all match in a single search
   - Enables powerful multi-dimensional discovery:
     - "Find standards for EHR data (topic)"
     - "that work with JSON (substrate)"
     - "maintained by HL7 (organization)"

## Performance

- **Caching:** Organization mappings loaded once and cached globally
- **Query Efficiency:** Organization searches use indexed LIKE queries across both columns
- **Lazy Loading:** Organizations only loaded when first accessed
- **Dual Column Search:** Single query searches both organization columns efficiently

## Real-World Use Cases

1. **Standards Discovery by Authority:**
   - "What standards does HL7 maintain?"
   - "Show me all W3C standards"
   - "Find CDISC-governed standards"

2. **Organization Research:**
   - "What healthcare organizations are represented?"
   - "Find international standards bodies"
   - "Search for government agencies"

3. **Compliance and Governance:**
   - "Which standards are IEEE-responsible?" (responsible_only=True)
   - "Find all standards where ISO is involved"
   - "Show standards with FDA relevance"

4. **Multi-Dimensional Queries:**
   - "Find genomics standards (topic) from NCBI (organization)"
   - "Show HL7 standards (organization) that use JSON (substrate)"
   - "Find W3C standards (organization) for web data (topic)"

## Summary

The organization functionality successfully extends the MCP server with powerful organization-based search capabilities. The implementation:

✅ Follows established patterns for consistency
✅ Supports dual-column search (relevant vs responsible)
✅ Integrates seamlessly with enhanced search
✅ Maintains 100% test coverage (53/53 tests passing)
✅ Covers 125 real-world organizations

Users can now discover standards based on:
- **What they do** (text search)
- **What data they concern** (topics)
- **What formats they work with** (substrates)
- **Who creates/maintains them** (organizations) ← NEW

This provides a comprehensive, four-dimensional approach to exploring the Bridge2AI Standards ecosystem, with special attention to governance and organizational relationships through the dual-column design.
