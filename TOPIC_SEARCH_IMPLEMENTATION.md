# Topic-Based Search Implementation

## Summary

Successfully implemented topic-based searching for the Standards Explorer MCP by integrating the DataTopics table (syn63096835) with the main DataStandardOrTool table (syn63096833).

## What Was Added

### 1. New Constants
- `SYNAPSE_TOPICS_TABLE_ID = "syn63096835"` - ID for the DataTopics table
- `_TOPICS_CACHE` - Global cache for topic name→ID mappings

### 2. New Functions

#### `_load_topics_mapping()`
- Queries the DataTopics table and builds a mapping dictionary
- Maps topic names (lowercase and original case) to topic IDs (e.g., "EHR" → "B2AI_TOPIC:9")
- Caches results globally to avoid repeated queries
- Returns empty dict on error (graceful degradation)

#### `search_by_topic_impl(topic_name, max_results)`
- Looks up topic name in the mapping
- Searches standards by matching topic ID in `concerns_data_topic` column
- Supports partial matching if exact match not found
- Returns standards tagged with that topic

#### `list_topics_impl()`
- Queries and returns all available data topics
- Includes ID, name, and description for each topic
- Useful for discovery and autocomplete

### 3. Enhanced Functions

#### `search_standards_impl()` - Now includes topic search!
- Added `include_topic_search` parameter (default: True)
- When search text matches a topic name, also searches by topic ID
- Returns `also_searched_topic` in results when a match occurs
- **Benefit**: Searching for "EHR" now finds both:
  - Standards with "EHR" in name/description (text search)
  - Standards tagged with B2AI_TOPIC:9 (topic search)

#### `get_standards_table_info_impl()`
- Now includes `topics_table_id` in returned info

### 4. New MCP Tools

#### `search_by_topic(topic_name, max_results=20)`
- Direct search for standards by data topic
- Example: `search_by_topic("Genomics")` finds genomics-related standards
- Includes detailed agent instructions for when to use

#### `list_topics()`
- Lists all 52 available data topics
- Returns ID, name, and description for each
- Useful for discovery and finding correct topic names

## How It Works

### Data Model
The `concerns_data_topic` column in the standards table contains JSON arrays:
```json
["B2AI_TOPIC:12", "B2AI_TOPIC:13"]
```

### Topic Mapping Flow
1. On first use, query DataTopics table: `SELECT id, name FROM syn63096835`
2. Build mapping: `{"ehr": "B2AI_TOPIC:9", "EHR": "B2AI_TOPIC:9", ...}`
3. Cache in `_TOPICS_CACHE` for subsequent queries

### Search Enhancement Flow
1. User searches for "EHR"
2. System looks up "ehr" in topics mapping → finds "B2AI_TOPIC:9"
3. SQL query becomes:
   ```sql
   WHERE (name LIKE '%EHR%' OR description LIKE '%EHR%')
      OR concerns_data_topic LIKE '%B2AI_TOPIC:9%'
   ```
4. Results include both text matches AND topic-tagged standards

## Usage Examples

### Basic Topic Search
```python
# List all topics
results = await client.call_tool("list_topics", {})
# Returns 52 topics with IDs, names, descriptions

# Search by topic
results = await client.call_tool("search_by_topic", {
    "topic_name": "EHR",
    "max_results": 20
})
# Returns standards tagged with B2AI_TOPIC:9
```

### Enhanced Regular Search
```python
# This now automatically includes topic search!
results = await client.call_tool("search_standards", {
    "search_text": "EHR",
    "max_results": 10
})
# Returns:
# - Standards with "EHR" in text fields
# - Standards tagged with B2AI_TOPIC:9
# - Indicates "also_searched_topic" in response
```

### Command Line
```bash
# List all topics
uv run python tests/example_topic_search.py --list

# Search by topic
uv run python tests/example_topic_search.py --topic "Genomics"

# Demo integrated search
uv run python tests/example_topic_search.py --demo
```

## Available Topics (Sample)

- Biology (B2AI_TOPIC:1)
- Cell (B2AI_TOPIC:2)
- Clinical Observations (B2AI_TOPIC:4)
- EHR (B2AI_TOPIC:9)
- EKG (B2AI_TOPIC:10)
- Gene (B2AI_TOPIC:12)
- Genome (B2AI_TOPIC:13)
- Image (B2AI_TOPIC:15)
- Omics (B2AI_TOPIC:23)
- Phenotype (B2AI_TOPIC:25)
- Proteomics (B2AI_TOPIC:27)
- Waveform (B2AI_TOPIC:37)

(52 total topics available)

## Testing

All existing tests pass (17/17):
- ✅ `test_tools.py` - 10 tests
- ✅ `test_mcp_integration.py` - 7 tests

New test files created:
- `tests/test_topic_search.py` - Tests topic loading and searching
- `tests/test_enhanced_search.py` - Tests integrated topic search
- `tests/example_topic_search.py` - Interactive demo CLI

## Benefits

1. **More comprehensive search results** - Text search + topic search in one call
2. **Discovery** - Users can browse by data domain (EHR, Genomics, etc.)
3. **Better categorization** - Standards grouped by subject area
4. **Flexible search** - Works with topic names, not just text matching
5. **Backward compatible** - All existing functionality preserved

## Agent Instructions

The MCP tools include instructions for LLM agents:

**For `search_by_topic`:**
- Use when user asks about standards for a specific domain
- Call `list_topics` first to find correct topic names
- Example: "What standards are for genomic data?" → search_by_topic("Genomics")

**For `search_standards` (enhanced):**
- Now automatically includes topic search when applicable
- No changes needed to agent behavior
- Results may include "also_searched_topic" indicator

## Performance

- Topic mapping cached after first load (~1 second initial query)
- Subsequent searches use cache (no additional overhead)
- SQL LIKE queries on JSON arrays are efficient for moderate table sizes
- Total of 52 topics, minimal memory footprint

## Files Modified

- `src/standards_explorer_mcp/main.py` - Core implementation
  - Added constants, caching, and 3 new functions
  - Enhanced existing search function
  - Added 2 new MCP tools
